## 2026-07-07 - Pixel chrome: remove intro dissolve

**Scope:** foundation-chrome, pixel-dissolve
**Status:** done

### Did
- Removed intro loading dissolve: no staggered cell reveal, no `pixel-chrome--active` content hide, no ~1.8s/4.1s settle timers.
- Mosaics boot in ambient base state; `foundation-pixel-chrome-readable` and settled events fire immediately on load.
- Kept ambient grow-only patch pulse (`AMBIENT_TIME_SCALE` 3.3) and green/warm gradient field for wave colors.

### Why
- User wanted the initial pixelated intro animation gone entirely; ambient pulse is fine.

## 2026-07-07 - Pixel chrome: faster intro, clearer foreground

**Scope:** foundation-chrome, pixel-dissolve
**Status:** done

### Did
- Split intro dissolve timing (`INTRO_TIME_SCALE` 1.5) from ambient pulse (`AMBIENT_TIME_SCALE` 3.3): readable ~1.8s, settled ~4.1s (was ~4s / ~9.2s).
- Raised header/footer content above ambient mosaic layers (`z-index: 5`); content fade 720ms via `--pixel-content-fade-duration`.
- Lightened nav links, wordmark, and lettermark contrast on slate chrome (brighter text colors + subtle shadow).

### Why
- User feedback: initial loading dissolve felt too slow; nav/wordmark/links read too faded against the pixel chrome background.
