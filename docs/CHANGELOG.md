## 2026-07-07 - Header instant visibility (pixel chrome + animations)

**Scope:** foundation-chrome, portal-animations, global-css
**Status:** done

### Did
- Synced portal scripts: mosaic build deferred to rAF; `pixel-chrome--done` on boot; header animations no longer wait on pixel-chrome event or double rAF.
- Nav base stagger 0ms; wordmark lines 0/50ms; transform-only motion with opacity 1 on first paint.
- Removed legacy pixel-chrome content opacity gates; inline `pixel-chrome--done` in `BaseLayout.astro` head.

### Why
- Header logo, wordmark, and nav were still hidden for seconds after intro dissolve removal due to sync mosaic work and CSS opacity gates.

### Files touched
- `public/scripts/foundation-pixel-chrome.js`, `public/scripts/portal-animations.js`
- `src/styles/global.css`, `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`

## 2026-07-07 - Awards data architecture copy + profile badge polish

**Scope:** awards, built-environment, federation-schema
**Status:** done

### Did
- Rewrote awards data-architecture section and export profile table labels without TLA-xxx identifiers; confident tone for published interchange profiles.
- Refined `DocsSection.astro` profile-table status badges (small-caps, subtle border, muted fill).
- Updated governance open-infrastructure pillar export-profile sentence; synced from la-frontend awards source.

### Why
- User-facing copy should describe IFC property sets, GeoJSON civic registries, USD sidecars, and spreadsheet crosswalks in professional language — not internal profile codes.

### Files touched
- `src/data/builtEnvironmentExports.js`, `src/data/foundationAwardsProgramme.js`, `src/data/governanceContent.js`, `src/components/DocsSection.astro`

## 2026-07-07 - Pixel chrome: remove intro dissolve

**Scope:** foundation-chrome, pixel-dissolve
**Status:** done

### Did
- Removed intro loading dissolve: no staggered cell reveal, no `pixel-chrome--active` content hide, no ~1.8s/4.1s settle timers.
- Mosaics boot in ambient base state; `foundation-pixel-chrome-readable` and settled events fire immediately on load.
- Kept ambient grow-only patch pulse (`AMBIENT_TIME_SCALE` 3.3) and green/warm gradient field for wave colors.

### Why
- User wanted the initial pixelated intro animation gone entirely; ambient pulse is fine.

## 2026-07-07 - Pixel chrome: faster intro, clearer foreground

**Scope:** foundation-chrome, pixel-dissolve
**Status:** done

### Did
- Split intro dissolve timing (`INTRO_TIME_SCALE` 1.5) from ambient pulse (`AMBIENT_TIME_SCALE` 3.3): readable ~1.8s, settled ~4.1s (was ~4s / ~9.2s).
- Raised header/footer content above ambient mosaic layers (`z-index: 5`); content fade 720ms via `--pixel-content-fade-duration`.
- Lightened nav links, wordmark, and lettermark contrast on slate chrome (brighter text colors + subtle shadow).

### Why
- User feedback: initial loading dissolve felt too slow; nav/wordmark/links read too faded against the pixel chrome background.

### Files touched
- `public/scripts/foundation-pixel-chrome.js`
- `src/styles/global.css`
- `src/components/SiteHeader.astro`
